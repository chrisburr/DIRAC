Installing LHCbWebAppDIRAC
==========================

The installation requires two steps:

#. Install the machine:

    The machine should be installed using the ``webportal`` puppet template. LHCbWepAppDIRAC is using ``Nginx`` for better performance, which is also puppetized. 
    The main configuration file used to install ``Nginx`` can be found `in this gitlab repository <https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-volhcb/blob/qa/code/manifests/vobox/webportal/nginx.pp>`_ .
    The ``site.conf`` configuration file is used for handling the user requests and pass to the ``Tornado`` based LHCbWebAppDIRAC component. The configuration file can be 
    found in  `this repository <https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-volhcb/blob/qa/code/templates/site.conf.erb>`_ .

#. Installing LHCbWebAppDIRAC extension::

    cd /home/dirac
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/integration/Core/scripts/install_site.sh
    chmod +x install_site.sh
    Edit install_site.sh add the Release = <version>
    ./install_site.sh install.cfg

Note: install.cfg file must exists in the /home/dirac directory

You may have have problem with the SELinux configuration. If you see the following error message, you need to generate 
the correct role::

    [dirac@lbvobox202 dirac]$ tail -200f data/log/nginx/error.log 
    2019/05/06 16:57:07 [crit] 19494#0: *1 connect() to 127.0.0.1:8000 failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: 128.141.212.123, server: lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/", host: "lbvobox202.cern.ch"

To do that please execute the following commands as root::

    grep nginx /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M nginx
    semodule -i nginx.pp
    refresh the web portal

NOTEs:

* You may need to execute the commands above more than once (for example if you change the certificate).
* Most probably, it may not work. Ask Joel to create the correct dirac.cfg file. The dirac.cfg file content must be the same as the existing web machine.
