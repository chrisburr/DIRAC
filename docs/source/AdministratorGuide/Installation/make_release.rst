==================
LHCbDIRAC Releases
==================

The following procedure applies fully to LHCbDIRAC production releases, like patches.
For pre-releases (AKA certification releases, there are some minor changes to consider).

Prerequisites
=============

The release manager needs to:

- be aware of the LHCbDIRAC repository structure and branching as highlighted in the  `contribution guide <https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
- have push access to the master branch of "upstream" (being part of the project "owners")
- have DIRAC installed
- have been granted write access to <webService>
- have "lhcb_admin" or "diracAdmin" role.
- have a Proxy

The release manager of LHCbDIRAC has the triple role of:

1. creating the release
2. making basic verifications
3. deploying it in production


1. Creating the release
=======================

Unless otherwise specified, (patch) releases of LHCbDIRAC are usually done "on top" of the latest production release of DIRAC.
The following of this guide assumes the above is true.

Creating a release of LHCbDIRAC means creating a tarball that contains the release code. This is done in 3 steps:

1. Merging "Merge Requests"
2. Propagating to the devel branch (for patches)
3. Creating the release tarball, add uploading it to the LHCb web service


Merging "Merge Requests"
````````````````````````

`Merge Requests (MR) <https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/merge_requests>`_ that are targeted to the master branch
and that have been approved by a reviewer are ready to be merged

Otherwise, simply click the "Accept merge request" button for each of them.

If you are making a Major release please merge devel to master follow the instruction: :ref:`devel_to_master`.

Propagate to the devel branch
`````````````````````````````

Before you start doing any merging it's good to setup the correct merge driver, you do this by adding to your .gitconfig

  [merge "ours"]
        driver = true

this lets git know which files you want to ignore when you merge `master` into `devel`.

Now, you need to make sure that what's merged in master is propagated to the devel branch. From the local fork::

  # get the updates (this never hurts!)
  git fetch upstream
  # create a "newDevel" branch which from the upstream/devel branch
  git checkout -b newDevel upstream/devel
  # merge in newDevel the content of upstream/master
  git merge upstream/master

The last operation may result in potential conflicts.
If happens, you'll need to manually update the conflicting files (see e.g. this `guide <https://githowto.com/resolving_conflicts>`_).
As a general rule, prefer the master fixes to the "HEAD" (devel) fixes. Remember to add and commit once fixed.

Please fix the conflict if some files are conflicting. Do not forget to to execute the following::

  git add -A && git commit -m " message"

Conflicts or not, you'll need to push back to upstream::

  # push "newDevel" to upstream/devel
  git push upstream newDevel:devel
  # delete your local newDevel
  git checkout upstream/devel
  git branch -d newDevel
  # keep your repo up-to-date
  git fetch upstream

Create/Trigger release
``````````````````````

To create a release you go to the pipelines https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/-/pipelines and go the last pipeline of the branch you want to tag.
At the end of the pipeline there is a manual trigger job with name `make_tag`, you clic on it and you will get the following windows

.. image:: trigger.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: trigger jobs

As key you can specify the versions you want your release to be based upon. If you don't specify any version only the LHCbDIRAC patch version will be increased for +1.
After you have set the proper values press trigger this manual action. This will create the release for you and creating the release tarball, and uploading it to the LHCb web service


```````````````````
Automatic procedure
```````````````````

When a new git tag is pushed to the repository, a gitlab-ci job takes care of testing, creating the tarball, uploading it to the web service, and to build the docker image. You can check it in the pipeline page of the repository (https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/pipelines).

It may happen that the pipeline fails. There are various reasons for that, but normally, it is just a timeout on the runner side, so just restart the job from the pipeline web interface. If it repeatedly fails building the tarball, try the manual procedure described bellow to understand.
**If any of the pipelines fails, don't try to do a release manually but rather investigate why.**


2. Making basic verifications
=============================

Once the tarball is done and uploaded, the release manager is asked to make basic verifications,
to see if the release has been correctly created. Within GitLab-CI, at https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/pipelines we run unit and integrations tests.
Please check that the pipeline for the tag passes before proceeding further.


3. Advertise the new release
============================

Before you start the release you must write an Elog entry 1 hour before you start the deployment.
You have to select Production and Release tick boxes.

When the intervention is over you must notify the users (reply to the Elog message).


4. Deploying the release
========================

Deploying a release means deploying it for the various installations::

* client
* server
* pilot


release for client
``````````````````
In each tag pipeline there is a manual trigger job called set_cvmfs_prod_link, this sets the production version link to the current deployed version.
Releases are automatically uploaded to cvmfs.
**If any of the pipelines fails, don't try to do a release manually but rather investigate why.**


Server
``````

````````````````````````````````
Method 1 (preferred): web portal
````````````````````````````````


Using the web portal:
  * You cannot do all the machines at once. Select a bunch of them (between 5 and 10). Fill in the version number and click update.
  * Repeate until you have them all.
  * Start again selecting them by block, but this time, click on "restart" to restart the components.


``````````````````````````````````````
Method 2: interactive via sysadmin cli
``````````````````````````````````````

To install it on the VOBOXes from lxplus::

  lhcb-proxy-init -g lhcb_admin
  dirac-admin-sysadmin-cli --host lbvoboxXYZ.cern.ch
  > update LHCbDIRAC v9r3p3
  > restart *


`````````````````````
Method 3: from lxplus
`````````````````````



The recommended way is the following::

      ssh lxplus
      mkdir -p DiracInstall && cd  DiracInstall
      curl https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/raw/devel/dist-tools/create_vobox_update.py -O
      python create_vobox_update.py vArBpC

This command will create 6 files called "vobox_update_MyLetter" then you can run in 6 windows the recipe for one single machine like that::

      ssh lxplus
      cd  DiracInstall ; source /cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lhcb/LHCBDIRAC/lhcbdirac ; lhcb-proxy-init -g lhcb_admin; dirac-admin-sysadmin-cli
            and from the prompt ::
               [host] : execfile vobox_update_MyLetter
               [host] : quit

Note:

It is normal if you see the following errors::

   --> Executing restart Framework SystemAdministrator
   [ERROR] Exception while reading from peer: (-1, 'Unexpected EOF')


In case of failure you have to update the machine by hand.
Example of a typical failure::

   --> Executing update v9r3p3
   Software update can take a while, please wait ...
   [ERROR] Failed to update the software
   Timeout (240 seconds) for '['dirac-install', '-r', 'v9r3p3', '-t', 'server', '-e', 'LHCb', '-e', 'LHCb', '/opt/dirac/etc/dirac.cfg']' call

Login to the failing machine, become dirac, execute manually the update, and restart everything. For example::

   ssh lbvobox11
   sudo su - dirac
   dirac-install -r v9r3p3 -t server -e LHCb -e LHCb /opt/dirac/etc/dirac.cfg
   lhcb-restart-agent-service
   runsvctrl t startup/Framework_SystemAdministrator/

Specify that this error can be ignored (but should be fixed ! )::

      2016-05-17 12:00:00 UTC dirac-install [ERROR] Requirements installation script /opt/dirac/versions/v8r2p42_1463486162/scripts/dirac-externals-requirements failed. Check /opt/dirac/versions/v8r2p42_1463486162/scripts/dirac-externals-requirements.err


WebPortal
`````````

When the web portal machine is updated then you have to compile the WebApp::

    ssh lhcb-portal-dirac.cern.ch
    sudo su - dirac
    #  (for example: dirac-install -r v9r3p3 -t server -l LHCb -e LHCb,LHCbWeb,WebAppDIRAC /opt/dirac/etc/dirac.cfg)
    dirac-install -r VERSIONTOBEINSTALLED -t server -l LHCb -e LHCb,LHCbWeb,WebAppDIRAC /opt/dirac/etc/dirac.cfg


When the compilation is finished::

    lhcb-restart-agent-service
    runsvctrl t startup/Framework_SystemAdministrator/


TODO
````

When the machines are updated, then you have to go through all the components and check the errors. There are two possibilities:
   1. Use the Web portal (SystemAdministrator)

   2. Command line::

       for h in $(grep 'set host' vobox_update_* | awk {'print $NF'}); do echo "show errors" | dirac-admin-sysadmin-cli -H $h; done | less

Pilot
`````

Update the pilot version from the CS, keeping 2 pilot versions, for example:

   /Operation/LHCb-Production/Pilot/Version = v9r3p3, v9r3p2

The newer version should be the first in the list

for checking and updating the pilot version. Note that you'll need a proxy that can write in the CS (i.e. lhcb-admin).
This script will make sure that the pilot version is update BOTH in the CS and in the json file used by pilots started in the vacuum.


.. _devel_to_master:

Basic instruction how to merge the devel branch into master (NOT for PATCH release)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Our developer model is to keep only two branches: master and devel. When we make a major release, we have to merge devel to master.
Before the merging,  create a new branch based on master using the web interface of GitLab.
This is for safety: save the in a new branch, named e.g. "v9r1" the last commit done for "v9r1" branch.

After, you can merge devel to master (the following does it in a new directory, for safety)::

    mkdir $(date +20%y%m%d) && cd $(date +20%y%m%d)
    git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC.git
    cd LHCbDIRAC
    git remote rename origin upstream
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout -b newMaster upstream/master
    git merge upstream/devel
    git push upstream newMaster:master

After when you merged devel to master, the 2 branches will be strictly equivalent.
You can make the tag for the new release starting from the master branch. You have to
merge devel to master for LHCbWebDIRAC as well::

    mkdir $(date +20%y%m%d) && cd $(date +20%y%m%d)
    git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/lhcb-dirac/LHCbWebDIRAC.git
    cd LHCbWebDIRAC/
    git remote rename origin upstream
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout -b newMaster upstream/master
    git merge upstream/devel
    git push upstream newMaster:master

When it is ready you can create the final tag for the new release.


5. Mesos cluster
========================

Mesos is currently only used for the certification.
In order to push a new version on the Mesos cluster, 3 steps are needed:

- Build the new image
- Push it the lhcbdirac gitlab repository
- Update the version of the running containers


Automatic procedure
````````````````````

The first two steps should be automatically done by the gitlab-ci of the LHCbDIRAC repository.
The last step will be taken care of by the gitlab-ci of the MesosClusterConf repository (https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/MesosClusterConf)
For a simple version upgrade, edit directly on the gitlab web page the file clusterConfiguration.json and replace the "version" attribute with what you want. Of course add a meaningful commit message.

Manual procedure
````````````````

This should in principle not happen. Remember that any manual change of the mesos cluster will be erased next time the gitlab-ci of the MesosClusterConf repository will run.
However, you can do all the above step manually.

All these functionalities have been wrapped up in a script (dirac-docker-mgmt), available on all the lbmesosadm* machines (01, 02)

The next steps are the following::

    # build the new image
    # this will download the necessary files, and build
    # the image localy
    dirac-docker-mgmt.py -v v8r5 --build

    # Push it to the remote lhcbdirac registry
    # Your credentials for gitlab will be asked
    dirac-docker-mgmt.py -v v8r5 --release

    # Update the version of the running containers
    # The services and number of instances running
    # will be preserved
    dirac-docker-mgmt.py -v v8r5 --deploy
