Introduction
------------

VMDIRAC has now been merged into the main DIRAC release (as of v7r3/7.3). It
consists of the following parts:

VirtualMachineDB (Database) - This is the database that stores the details of each VM
managed by VMDIRAC. There should be one instance of this on your system.

CloudDirector (Agent) - This is analogous to the core DIRAC SiteDirector. It inspects
the TaskQueues, works out if there are any compatible jobs waiting (without
existing VMs) for cloud resources and starts VM instances as needed. The VM
details are stored in the database for future reference. You need at least one
CloudDirector, for multi community/VO services, it's advisable to have one
CloudDirector per community.

VirtualMachineManager (Service) - This service provides the virtual machine
life-cycle management interface; the CLI tools contact this service to
list/kill running VMs. It also has an inbuilt thread that will inspect existing
VMs, tidying up any that are stopped or haven't reported back for a long time.

VirtualMachineMonitor (Agent) - This agent monitors the health of the current
VM it is running on an reports it back to the VirtualMachineManager. It should
not be installed on the central DIRAC instance, but started in the cloud VM
instances themselves. This lets the VirtualMachineManager know that the
instance is still alive and also handles stopping the instance after any
tasks/jobs have finished.

VMDIRAC WebApp Extention - This WebApp plugin adds an extra VirtualMachines tab
to the usual DIRAC webinterface for summarising the contents of the database.

---------------
Install VMDIRAC
---------------

On a DIRAC server (generally collocated with the other WorkloadManagement
system components), configure and install the extra components:

* Resource configuration

  In the configuration add the User/Password information to connect to the Cloud endpoint. Also you should put a valid path for the host certificate, *e.g.*:

  ::

      Resources
      {
        Sites
        {
          Cloud
          {
            Cloud.LUPM.fr
            {
              Cloud
              {
                example.cloud.hostname
                {
                  User = xxxx
                  Password = xxxx
                  HostCert = /opt/dirac/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
                  HostKey = /opt/dirac/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
                  CreatePublicIP = True
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }

* Install the following components:

  * DB: VirtualMachineDB
  * Service: WorkloadManagement_VirtualMachineManager
  * Agent: WorkloadManagement_CloudDirector

------------------------------------
Setup for using cloudinit and Pilot3
------------------------------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using OpenStack with an application credential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The user must have access to the OpenStack cloud and be allowed to start up instances.
* Login to the cloud webinterface with your account.
* Go to the identity -> Application credentials panel
* Create a new credential with any name, no expire and no roles selected
* Copy the ID and secret strings somewhere safe for a moment
*   Put the ID and string into a new file on the DIRAC server running the
    CloudDirectors in the following format (one line, separated by a space):
    <ID> <Secret>
* Make sure the file is owned by the user running dirac and has 0600 permissions.
* Add the location of this file to the Resource Settings.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenStack Resource Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On the OpenStack Resource you will need the following:

* user account
* user's ssh key uploaded to the OpenStack server: Associated with the instance for debugging.
  This key is user specific, not project specific.
* flavour (ID or name)
* image (ID or name)
* network (ID or name)

    * Properties = VmRpcOperation (needed by the VirtualMachineMonitorAgent running on the VM to be authorized to send Heartbeats to the VirtualMachineManager service)

* The VirtualMachines panel is now included in the main WebApp release.
* If using the old (non cloudinit) bootstrap, you must Create sym links for the
  old bootstrap scripts:
