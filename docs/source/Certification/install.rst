LHCbDIRAC Certification (development) Releases
======================================================

The following procedure applies to pre-releases (AKA certification releases)
and it is a simpler version of what applies to production releases.

This page details the duty of the release manager.
The certification manager duties are detailed in the next page.


What for
========

The *release manager* of LHCbDIRAC has the role of:

1. creating the pre-release
2. making basic tests
3. deploying it in the certification setup

The *certification manager* would then follow-up on this by:
4. making even more tests

And, after several iterations of the above, before:
5. merging in the production branch

Points 4 and 5 won't anyway be part of this first document.


1. Creating the release
=======================

Unless otherwise specified, certification releases of LHCbDIRAC are done "on top" of the latest pre-release of DIRAC.
The following of this guide assumes the above is true.

Creating a pre-release of LHCbDIRAC means creating a tarball that contains the code to certify. This is done in 2 steps:

1. Merging "Merge Requests"
2. Creating the release tarball, add uploading it to the LHCb web service

But before:

Pre
```

If you use a version of git prior to 1.8, remove the option *--pretty* in the command line

Verify what is the last tag of DIRAC::

  # it should be in this list:
  git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=10)

A tarball containing it is should be already
uploaded `here <http://diracproject.web.cern.ch/diracproject/tars/>`_

You may also look inside the .cfg file for the DIRAC release you're looking for: it will contain an "Externals" version number,
that should also be a tarball uploaded in the same location as above.

If all the above is ok, we can start creating the LHCbDIRAC pre-release.


Merging "Merge Requests"
````````````````````````

`Merge Requests (MR) <https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/merge_requests>`_ that are targeted to the devel branch
and that have been approved by a reviewer are ready to be merged

If there are no MRs, or none ready: please skip to the "update the CHANGELOG" subsection.

Otherwise, simply click the "Accept merge request" button for each of them.

Then, from the LHCbDIRAC local fork you need to update some files::

  # if you start from scratch otherwise skip the first 2 commands
  git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC.git
  cd LHCbDIRAC
  git remote add upstream https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC.git
  # update your "local" upstream/master branch
  git fetch upstream
  # create a "newDevel" branch which from the upstream/devel branch
  git checkout -b newDevel upstream/devel
  # determine the tag you're going to create by checking what was the last one from the following list (add 1 to the "p"):
  git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=5)
  # Update the version in the __init__ file:
  vim LHCbDIRAC/__init__.py
  # Update the version in the releases.cfg file:
  vim LHCbDIRAC/releases.cfg
  # Update the version in the Dockerfile file:
  vim container/lhcbdirac/Dockerfile
  # For updating the CHANGELOG, get what's changed since the last tag
  # please use the proper LHCbDIRAC tag; replace v8r2p46
  # CHRIS: I guess the proper DIRAC tag is the latest pre-release. 
  # However the trick here is to know which commit belong the the previous patch
  # release. Anyway, all this should go once we use the proper CHANGELOG script
  git log --pretty=oneline ${t}..HEAD | grep -Ev "($(git log --pretty=oneline  ${t}..v8r2p46 | awk {'print $1'} | tr '\n' '|')BOOM)"
  # copy the output, add it to the CHANGELOG (please also add the DIRAC version)
  vim CHANGELOG # please, remove comments like "fix" or "pylint" or "typo"...
  # Commit in your local newDevel branch the 3 files you modified
  git add -A && git commit -av -m "<YourNewTag>"


Time to tag and push::

  # make the tag
  git tag -a <YourNewTag> -m <YourNewTag>
  # push "newDevel" to upstream/devel
  git push --tags upstream newDevel:devel
  # delete your local newDevel
  git branch -d newDevel


Remember: you can use "git status" at any point in time to make sure what's the current status.


When a new git tag is pushed to the repository, a gitlab-ci job takes care of testing,
creating the tarball, uploading it to the web service, and to build the docker image.



2. Making basic verifications
==============================

Once the tarball is done and uploaded, the release manager is asked to make basic verifications, via Jenkins,
if the release has been correctly created.

The tests may vary, but are announced on the Trello board, and on the Slack channel 'lhcb-certification' of the 'lhcbdirac' team.

If you are running tests from lxplus, make sure that you are in the certification setup (e.g. check the content of your .dirac.cfg file)


3. Deploying the release
==========================

Deploying a release means deploying it for some installation::

* client
* server
* pilot


release for client
``````````````````

Please refer to this `TWIKI page <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCb/ProjectRelease#LHCbDirac>`_
a quick test to validate the installation is to run the SHELL script $LHCBRELEASE/LHCBDIRAC/LHCBDIRAC_vXrY/LHCbDiracSys/test/client_test.csh

go to https://jenkins-lhcb-nightlies.web.cern.ch/job/nightly-builds/job/release/build page for asking to install the client release in AFS and CVMFS:

* in the field "Project list" put : "Dirac vNrMpK LHCbGrid vArB LHCbDirac vArBpC " (LHCbGrid version can be found: https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-dirac/LHCbDIRAC/blob/devel/dist-tools/projectConfig.json)
* in the field "platforms" put : "x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt x86_64-slc6-gcc62-opt x86_64-centos7-gcc62-opt"

Then click on the "BUILD" button

* within 10-15 min the build should start to appear in the nightlies page https://lhcb-nightlies.cern.ch/release/
* if there is a problem in the build, it can be re-started via the dedicated button (it will not restart by itself after a retag)


When the release is finished https://lhcb-nightlies.cern.ch/release/, you can deploy to the client to afs dev area or prod.

prod area
``````````

If you want to deploy this release to production release area, you
have to create a JIRA task and make the request via https://its.cern.ch/jira/projects/LHCBDEP.

* NOTE: If some package is already released, please do not indicate in the Jira task. For example: a Jira task when:
    * DIRAC is not released, then the message in the JIRA task: Summary:Dirac v6r14p37 and LHCbDirac v8r2p50; Description: Please release  Dirac and  LHCbDirac in  this order  based on build 1526;
    * DIRAC is released, then the message in the JIRA task: Summary:LHCbDirac v8r2p50;  Description: Please release  LHCbDirac based on build 1526;

Server
``````

To install it on the VOBOXes (certification only) from lxplus::

  lhcb-proxy-init  -g diracAdmin
  dirac-admin-sysadmin-cli --host lbtestvobox.cern.ch
  >update LHCbDIRAC-v8r4-pre1
  >restart *

Today, the other cert machine in use is lbtestvobox2.cern.ch.

The (better) alternative is using the web portal.



Pilot
``````

Update the pilot version from the CS.
