  RPCClientSelector can replace RPCClient (with import RPCClientSelector as RPCClient)

  used for a service. If the url of the service uses HTTPS, TornadoClient is returned, else it returns RPCClient

    from DIRAC.Core.Tornado.Client.RPCClientSelector import RPCClientSelector as RPCClient
    myService = RPCClient("Framework/MyService")
